# School_District_Analysis
Looking at standardized test sources relative to size, funding, and type of school

## Overview of the School District Analysis 
The purpose of this analysis was to gather standardized test data from 15 different schools in a school district to see if any trends emerge. This will let the various people in charge help determine how to best use and allocate resources. In this particular case, there was fear of tampering with a school's test scores; specifically Thomas High School's 9th grade. So we had to remove them before constructing our analysis.
